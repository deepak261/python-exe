 S02AQ02

Re-write the earlier question of S02Q02 using functions :

     - Using the starting and ending values of your carâ€™s odometer, 
            and the measure of fuel consumed, 
            calculate the number of stops one should make for refuelling 
            while travelling from Bangalore to Goa,
'''




def distance(x,y):
    return y-x

def main():
    start = int(input("enter the starting value of odometer:"))
    end = int(input("enter the ending value of odometer:"))
    mileage = 17
    tank_capacity = 20
    fuel = distance(start,end)//mileage
    print('fuel:',fuel,'liters')
    stops = fuel//tank_capacity
    print('no of stops:',stops)
    print('distance:',distance(start,end),'kms')

#Main starts from here
main()
