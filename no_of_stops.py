start = int(input("enter the starting value of odometer "))
end = int(input("enter the ending value of odometer "))
distance = end-start
tank_capacity = 20
car_mileage = 17
fuel = (distance//car_mileage)
print('fuel:',fuel,'liters')
stops = (fuel//tank_capacity)
print('no of stops:',stops)
print('total distance:',distance,'kms')
